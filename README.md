The sections that are included in this project include: 
  
  - Description
  - Installation
  - Usage
  - Contribute
  - Testing
  - License (if the user chooses to include it) 
  - Questions.

  ## Installation

  In order to use this project, make sure to sure 'npm install' to obtain the appropriate npm modules that allow for the execution of the application. Please also make sure to read this entire README.md file for all additional information.

  ## Usage

  To start the execution of the application, type 'node index' or 'node index.js' and the series of prompts will guide you through the process of data collection. The License section is optional, with the default value set to true to motivate the user to provide for licensing information. If a license is shown, then the License section is created both in the README.md body and in its Table of Content, and a badge is added at the top of the file, right below the project title name.

  A quick demo was recorded and can be found on the link below:
